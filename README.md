# GitHub Pages Website.

I've recreated my GitHub Pages website using ReactJS.

I mainly did this as ReactJS was a lot easier to develop "app" like websites.
This saved me a lot of time as I no longer needed to fiddle with raw `HTML` and
directly modify the `HTML` file with JavaScript to achieve the behaviour I wanted.
